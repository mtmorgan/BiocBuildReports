Description: Bioconductor builds all packages in the 'devel' and
    current release branches on a nightly basis. This package scrapes
    the build report to summarize overall builds. It includes
    facilities for easily tracking the outcome of recent commits, as
    well as consequences of commits for package reverse dependencies.
